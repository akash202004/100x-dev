## 🪵 Logging

Logging refers to the practice of recording events, messages, or data points generated by software applications and systems. Logs can include:

* **Error Messages**: Details about errors and exceptions.
* **Access Logs**: Records of who accessed what and when.
* **Audit Logs**: Used for compliance and security tracking.

---

## 📈 Monitoring

Monitoring is the continuous observation of a system to ensure optimal operation. Key metrics include:

* **CPU Usage**
* **Memory Usage**
* **Disk I/O**
* **Disk Space**
* **Network Traffic**
* **Application Performance**

---

## 🚨 Alerts

The goal of monitoring is to **notify users when spikes or abnormalities** occur in system metrics.

Use alerts for:

* System downtime
* High CPU or memory usage
* Increased error rates

### 🛠 How to Set Up Alerts

1. **Create an Alert**
2. **Attach it to a Policy**
3. **Add Notification Channels** (Email, Slack, etc.)

## 🌐 Status Pages

Status pages communicate real-time health to end users.

* Example: [https://status.100xdevs.com](https://status.100xdevs.com)

## 🧪 Experiment

Simulate high CPU usage:

```js
// index.js
let c = 1;
while (true) {
  if (Math.random() < 0.1) {
    c = c + 1;
  }
}
```

### Monitor It:

## 🧾 NRQL (New Relic Query Language)

**NRQL** is a SQL-like language used in New Relic to query app and infrastructure data.

### 🔍 CPU Usage - All Data

```sql
SELECT average(cpuPercent) AS 'CPU used %' 
FROM SystemSample 
WHERE (entityGuid = 'xyz') 
TIMESERIES AUTO
```

---

### 📈 High CPU Usage Only

```sql
SELECT average(cpuPercent) AS 'CPU used %' 
FROM SystemSample 
WHERE (entityGuid = 'NDQ2MDY2NXxJTkZSQXxOQXwzOTczMjM4ODc0NzI4NDk0NzYz') 
AND cpuPercent > 2 
TIMESERIES AUTO
```

---

### 📊 Multiple Graphs in Same Timeline

```sql
SELECT average(transmitBytesPerSecond) AS 'Transmit bytes per second', 
       average(receiveBytesPerSecond) AS 'Receive bytes per second' 
FROM NetworkSample 
WHERE (entityGuid = 'NDQ2MDY2NXxJTkZSQXxOQXwtMzE2MTI3OTkyNzM3NDEzMTE1Mw') 
TIMESERIES AUTO
```

### 🧩 Using Facets (Compare Multiple Hosts)

```sql
SELECT average(cpuPercent) AS 'CPU used %' 
FROM SystemSample 
WHERE entityGuid IN ('xyz', 'abc') 
FACET entityGuid 
TIMESERIES AUTO
```
